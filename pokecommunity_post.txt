[B][SIZE="5"][glow=purple]Lore[/glow][/SIZE][/B][JUSTIFY]Thousands of years ago, a catacalsymic event upended the majority of the planet's landmass. Sea levels rose to drastic levels, forcing Pokémon and mankind alike into the formerly-high-altitude region of Keplara. Generations later, the region's ever-growing population would force humanity to encroach upon the feral Pokémon's territory, increasing tensions across the region. With no other land on Earth to populate, Keplara's human residents have begun to explore alternatives for human expansion. Some choose to explore the land or sea, but others turn their attention towards the stars and space-faring technology.[/JUSTIFY]

[B][SIZE="5"][glow=purple]Story[/glow][/SIZE][/B]
You have lived your whole life in Andromeda City, the metropolitan heart of Keplara. Your father works for the Andromeda PD; your mother is the local Antares League gym leader. Someday you'll get a Trainer's License of your own and become a well-regarded Pokémon trainer yourself.

But today is not that day. Instead, today is an exciting day for Andromeda City: your mother's Antares League gym is moving into the snazziest new digs, all the way up to the top floors of the recently-completed Pokémon community skyscraper! There's still a few things left to move and unpack before the grand opening, but it's nothing that you and your father can't handle. What could possibly go wrong?

[spoiler]Certainly not a poorly-timed earthquake. Definitely not an undiscovered cavern holding a mysterious artifact. And there's no way that some shady organization would choose this day to unveil their plan to rapidly accelerate the development of Keplara's space exploration. If any of these things did happen, then at least it would be a good excuse to get your Trainer's License ahead of schedule.[/spoiler]
