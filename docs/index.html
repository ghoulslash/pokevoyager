            Thousands of years ago, a catacalsymic event upended the majority of the planet's landmass. Sea levels rose to drastic levels, forcing Pokémon and mankind alike into the formerly-high-altitude region of Keplara. Generations later, the region's ever-growing population would force humanity to encroach upon the feral Pokémon's territory, increasing tensions across the region. With no other land on Earth to populate, Keplara's human residents have begun to explore alternatives for human expansion. Some choose to explore the land or sea, but others turn their attention towards the stars and space-faring technology.
            </p>

            <p>
            You have lived your whole life in Andromeda City, the metropolitan heart of Keplara. Your father works for the Andromeda PD; your mother is the local Antares League gym leader. Someday you'll get a Trainer's License of your own and become a well-regarded Pokémon trainer yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
            But today is not that day. Instead, today is an exciting day for Andromeda City: your mother's Antares League gym is moving into the snazziest new digs, all the way up to the top floors of the recently-completed Pokémon community skyscraper! There's still a few things left to move and unpack before the grand opening, but it's nothing that you and your father can't handle. What could possibly go wrong?

            <ul>
                <li>A Game Boy Advance emulator.</li>
                <li>A legally-obtained copy of Pokémon Emerald 1.0.</li>
                <li>A patch file for the latest version of Pokémon Voyager, which you can download here.</li>
                <li>A tool to patch ROM files, or a modern web browser other than Safari.</li>

                <li>Navigate to to <a href="https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php">this web patcher</a>.</li>

                <li>Click the "Patch" button next to the second box and select the Pokémon Voyager patch file.</li>
                <li>Click the "Patch" button on the bottom.</li>
                <li>If done correctly, this tool will show you a "Success!" message and a download button will appear. Use it to download a playable Pokémon Voyager ROM.</li>
            </ol>
