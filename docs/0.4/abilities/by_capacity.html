<!-- TODO at some point: ability dex heading -->



<p>
Pokémon Voyager introduces the capability for a Pokémon to wield multiple abilities in battle.
Similar to battle moves, each Pokémon has a level-up learnset and tutorable learnset for abilities, and each Pokémon can equip up to four of the abilities that they have learned.
But very differently from battle moves, a "capacity" and "cost" system is used to constrain which of its learned abilities a Pokémon can equip at a given time.
</p>
<p>
Each Pokémon species has an ability "capacity" value, and each ability has an assigned "cost" to equip. At a given time, a Pokémon can equip up to four abilities whose total cost does not exceed the Pokémon's capacity. To make things more interesting, abilities which infamously add a drawback such as 
    <a href="abilities/truant.html">Truant</a>
 have a negative cost, which allows a Pokemon to equip a greater number of more powerful abilities.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of Pokemon species, and a lot of abilities. How did we determine the right numbers? Pokemon with higher base stat totals should have lower capacities, and more powerful abilities should higher costs. But shouldn't each Pokemon species inherited from canon should have enough capacity to equip any one of its "innate" abilities. And each Pokemon must have some path to equipping all of the abilities in its learnset (adjusting its capacity with the right combination of negative abilities). And there are more constraints you can imagine wanting to add.
</p>
<p>
Rather than come up with capacities and costs of each species and ability manually, the Voyager team has written an algorithm to do it. Choosing capacities an costs is an instance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction">constraint satisfaction problem</a>. There are many solutions to all of the constraints, but to prevent anything from being too strong we want the <i>minimum</i> solution. This transforms the problem into an instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">integer linear programming</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a starting point for our constraints, we have made a tier list containing all of Pokemon Voyager's abilities. Descriptions of each tier and the abilities we assigned to it are below.
</p>
<p>
Constructive, specific feedback about the assignments our algorithm has produced is welcome in the <tt>#suggestions</tt> channel of the Pokemon Voyager discord.
