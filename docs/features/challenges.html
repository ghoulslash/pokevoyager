					<td><b>Type Challenge</b></td>

						Limit yourself to only catching/obtaining Pokémon of a given type. You will only get a single, random starter of the type-challenge type. This is to prevent the player from disabling the type challenge mid-game and obtaining all three starters
						<p>
						Special Cases:
						<ul>
							<li>If types are randomized: a random starter will be set to the type-challenge type. you will not obtain the other starters</li>
							<li>If species are randomized: your starter will be a random species of the challenge type</li>
							<li>If types + species are randomized: your starter will be a random first-stage species that has the type-challenge type from the type randomizer</li>
						</ul>

				<tr>
					<td><b>Name Challenge</b></td>
					<td>
						Limit yourself to only catching/obtaining Pokémon whose name starts with a letter from a given range. You will only get a single, random starter of the name-challenge characters. This is to prevent the player from disabling the name challenge mid-game and obtaining all three starters

					<td><b>Nuzlocke</b></td>
					<td>
						This mode limits the player to catching only the first Pokémon in each area (route, cave, etc). In addition, it enforces nuzlocke rules based on the following difficulty conditions:
						<p>
						<b>Whiteout Conditions:</b> Certain storyline battles may override these conditions and continue with a unique event.
							<ul>
								<li><i>Heal Party</i>: Heals your party and continues with the game.</li>
								<li><i>Standard</i>: Sends you to the PC to be healed.</li>
								<li><i>Soft Reset</i>: Whiting out resets the game, making you lose your progress.</li>
								<li><i>Delete Save</i>: The most difficult mode. Whiting out deletes your save file, making you start over.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Fainting Behavior:</b>
							<ul>
								<li><i>Revive After Battle</i>: After the battle, your Pokémon will be revived to full health.</li>
								<li><i>Standard</i>: Your Pokémon can be revived during battle and will remain fainted after battle otherwise.</li>
								<li><i>No Reviving in Battle</i>: You cannot use revives in battle.</li>
								<li><i>Send to PC</i>: Cannot revive in battle. When fainted, your Pokémon will be sent to the PC after battle. Your last Pokémon fainting will not be sent to the PC, and the whiteout behavior will be handled based on the whiteout condition (see above).</li>
								<li><i>Remove from Party</i>: Cannot revive in battle. Upon fainting, your Pokémon will be released after battle.</li>
