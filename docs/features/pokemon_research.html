			In Pokémon Voyager, you will encounter entirely new species that even your Pokédex cannot identify! Fortunately for you, there is a Pokémon research lab in Carina Outpost!
			</ul>
			<ul>
			Each Pokémon trait will need to be individually researched in order to display the correct information. A list of traits and how you can research them during gameplay is shown below. If any of the fields are listed as "See Brynn", the only way to research these traits is to talk to Dr. Brynn, who can be found in the top right of the research lab (the left-most room in Carina Outpost). You can always submit a sample to Brynn to research a trait, but some can be researched during gameplay. Note that submitting a sample removes the Pokemon from your party, except when researching their name.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Abilities - Trigger each ability in battle</li>
				<li>Ability Disc Learnset - Teach the new species an ability</li>
				<li>Base Stats - See Brynn<li>
				<li>Catch Rate - Each Poke Ball you throw adds a catch rate score based on the ball's efficacy. Reaching a score of 15 will gives you enough information to unlock this trait<li>
				<li>Description - see Brynn<li>
				<li>Egg Group - Trigger an egg waiting in the daycare. If you trigger an egg with an evolved species, this will also unlock the Egg Group of the pre-evolution species<li>
				<li>EVs - Defeat one of the species in battle<li>
				<li>Evolutions - Evolve the species. Final evolutions will have this trait unlocked upon evolving, or being researched, whichever comes first.<li>
				<li>Exp Yield - Defeat at least 3 of the given species<li>
				<li>Growth Rate - Level up the species 5 times<li>
				<li>Items - Encounter at least 5 of the species<li>
				<li>Level Up Moves - Trigger at least 5 level-up move attempts<li>
				<li>Name - See Brynn. This is the only field in which a provided sample will be given back.</li>
				<li>TM Moves - Teach the Pokemon a TM</li>
				<li>Types - Attack the species with a not-very-effective, effective, and super-effective attack</li>
