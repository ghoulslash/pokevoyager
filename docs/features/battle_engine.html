            Pokemon Voyager combines aspects of older-generation and newer-generation
            Pokemon for its experience system.
            <a href="items/exp._share.html">Exp. Share</a> and
            <a href="items/exp._all.html">Exp. All</a>
            are both obtainable items which can be dynamically deployed to adhere to your preferred playstyle.
            Whatever your configuration, the total amount of experience gained by your party remains the same, so all configurations should fit well into Voyager's level curve.

			<p><b>Exp. Share</b></p>
            <p align="justify">
            The <a href="items/exp._share.html">Exp. Share</a> is a held item. A Pokemon in your party holding one gains experience and effort values though it had participated in the battle. A Pokemon in that participates in the battle while also holding an Exp. Share gains an extra share of experience.
            </p>
			<p><b>Exp. All</b></p>
            <p>
            The <a href="items/exp._all.html">Exp. All</a> is a key item obtained
            early in your journey. It has several different modes which distribute
            earned experience to your party in different ways.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Even</b>: experience is distributed evenly amongst all party members.
                    Pokemon holding <a href="items/exp._share.html">Exp. Share</a> count
                    as two party members and get an extra share of earned experience.

                <li>
                    <b>Skew</b>: experience is distributed throughout your party,
                    with lower-level Pokemon earning more experience. The amount of experience
                    each party member earns is based on the proportion of its level to
                    the total level of your whole party.
                    Pokemon holding <a href="items/exp._share.html">Exp. Share</a> are treated
                    as though they are half of their current level.

            In contrast to experience points,
            effort values are gained only by Pokemon who participated
            in the battle or Pokemon holding an <a href="items/exp._share.html">Exp. Share</a>.
            Pokemon who meet neither condition do not gain effort values.
